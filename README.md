# [Project 1 - Player Comparison Tool](https://github.com/NarinCodes/Player_Comparison)
This tool allows users to compare the stats of different soccer players. The code has been written entirely in Python, and uses the Beautiful Soup package to srape data from a soccer website. After the collection of relevant stats, extensive data processing is done using pandas and numpy before creating a dashboard using the Matplotlib package. The dashboard contains a scatterplot of Goals per Match vs. Expected Goals per Match, and a soccer field visualization depicting all the shots taken by the players. The soccer field visualization provides information about where the shots were taken, the quality of the chances, and their respective outcomes (i.e. goal or no goal).

# [Project 2 - House Price Predictor](https://github.com/NarinCodes/House_Price_Prediction)
The Bangalore housing dataset from Kaggle is used to build a machine learning model that can predict the price of a house. The user only needs to specify the no. of bedrooms and bathrooms, total square ft. of area, and the location of the house for which a predicted price is needed. Several steps of data cleaning, feature engineering, and outlier removal are done using the Python pandas library. Data visualizations are done using the Matplotlib package, and the final model is selected based on Cross Validation and Grid Search results from Scikit-Learn. Accuracy scores from Linear Regression, Lasso, and Decision Tree models were compared before choosing the most robust model for making predictions (final accuracy of 81%).
